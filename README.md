# Hi, I'm James Le 👋🏼  👨🏽‍🎓 👨🏽‍💻 🇻🇳 🇺🇸

I'm a machine learning researcher who is deeply interested in tinkering with neural networks, building recommendation systems, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production.
I write often about theoretical deep learning and applied MLOps.

- 🔭 I’m currently doing research at the intersection of [`deep learning and recommendation systems`](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/transfer-rec)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to [`crack the data science interview`](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/cracking-the-data-science-interview)
- 👯 I’m looking to evangelize and build out the community with [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to get more guests on [Datacast](https://datacast.simplecast.com/)
